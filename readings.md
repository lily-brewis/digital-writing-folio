## Week 1 Readings 

### "Decolonise" E-Literature? On Weeding the E-Lit Garden - Kathi Inman Berens 

- "Permaculture" - Gardens as 'self-sustaining' with no human involvement 
'Permacultures opposite is a gardener removing pests & weeds 

- E-Lit
'technotexts, non-trivial effort, high modernism'
are they restricting access to content creators?
could e-lit's 'permaculture' be made stronger through 'decolonisation'? 

- On Florian Cramer's 'Post-Digital Writing' 

     the definition of literary is restrictive because it favours 
 
     a\ works where author attribution is discernable 
 
     b\ fiction (& poetry) stand for literature as a whole 
 
     c\ peer review validates publication 

- Flores - authorial intention to make e-lit is not a precondition for a work to be defined as e-lit (can be made whether creatirs know e-lit as a concept or not) 

- "Prestige is not just a reputation-enhancer, as it is in a coterie; reputation in a scholarly field earns financial and status rewards: speaking invitations, endowed proffessorships, research budgets, festschifts" 

- e-lit began as a coterie- has become a scholarly field



### "Electronic Literature : What is it?' - N. Katherine Hayles 

- Early works- 'blocks of text' - lexia (1st gen/'classic') 
- Later works - navigation schemes and interface metaphors 
              - more graphics, colours, animation, sound  > (2nd gen/'contmeporary electronic lit') 
              
- The Z-axis 

  An additional deimension for text display, behaviour & manipulation, presents interactive possibilities 
  
  
  ### Electronic Literature as Digital Humanities - James O'Sullivan 
  
  - The Electronic Literature Organisation (ELO)'s def. of e-lit:
    "works with important literary aspects that take advantage of the capabilities and contexts provided by the stand-alone or networked computer"
    
    "An essentail component (of e-lit) needs to be the artistic engagememnt of written language in digital media" 
    
 - Three generations of e-lit 
 - 1. Pre-web experimentation w\ electronic and digital media 
 - 2. Begins w\ the web in 1995 - present 
       consists of innovative works created w\ custom interfaces & forums, mostly published in the open web

       (2nd and 3rd gen coexist) 
       
       
 ## Week 2 Readings 
 ### From the Electronic Literature Collection 
 
 #### Overall Thoughts
 
 The creativity and variety of craft and presentation takes my understanding/experience of writing to a new level. I appreciate the innovation and tech-savvy of
 these creators - especially the nostalgic disappointment of opening a piece and not being able to read/interact with it due to the ancient 2006 file not being 
 compatible with current software - but found myself drawn to the works that favour a more traditional or conventional approach, not because I'm boring, but 
 because I find them easier to follow. Many of the pieces fill me with anxiety that I am missing content, not reading/following properly, or clicking one of two
 links, the second of which I will never see because I have gone down a different path. But maybe that is the intention of some of these authors. 
 
 Something that interested me was the percievable changes from volume to volume. The advancement of technological capability is an obvious observation to make, 
 and so is the scope - with each volume featuring pieces in various different languages from a growing international pool of authors. On another note, I noticed
 what I thought was an increase in the level of complication and snobbery with each newer volume. I clicked on and then very soon clicked off many of the pieces 
 from volume three (2016). The simplicity of the first volume was more enjoyable, it seems playful and experimental rather than pretentious. Even just the layout
 of the page - hovering the mouse over each thumbnail to see the title/preview in the little window - the mid-2000s internet blue. I liked it.
