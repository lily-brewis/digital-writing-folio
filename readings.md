### "Decolonise" E-Literature? On Weeding the E-Lit Garden - Kathi Inman Berens 

- "Permaculture" - Gardens as 'self-sustaining' with no human involvement 
'Permacultures opposite is a gardener removing pests & weeds 

- E-Lit
'technotexts, non-trivial effort, high modernism'
are they restricting access to content creators?
could e-lit's 'permaculture' be made stronger through 'decolonisation'? 

- On Florian Cramer's 'Post-Digital Writing' 

     the definition of literary is restrictive because it favours 
 
     a\ works where author attribution is discernable 
 
     b\ fiction (& poetry) stand for literature as a whole 
 
     c\ peer review validates publication 

- Flores - authorial intention to make e-lit is not a precondition for a work to be defined as e-lit (can be made whether creatirs know e-lit as a concept or not) 

- "Prestige is not just a reputation-enhancer, as it is in a coterie; reputation in a scholarly field earns financial and status rewards: speaking invitations, endowed proffessorships, research budgets, festschifts" 

- e-lit began as a coterie- has become a scholarly field

  - The Electronic Literature Organisation (ELO)'s def. of e-lit:
    "works with important literary aspects that take advantage of the capabilities and contexts provided by the stand-alone or networked computer"
    
    "An essentail component (of e-lit) needs to be the artistic engagememnt of written language in digital media"
