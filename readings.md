### "Decolonise" E-Literature? On Weeding the E-Lit Garden - Kathi Inman Berens

     a\ works where author attribution is discernable 
 
     b\ fiction (& poetry) stand for literature as a whole 
 
     c\ peer review validates publication 

- Flores - authorial intention to make e-lit is not a precondition for a work to be defined as e-lit (can be made whether creatirs know e-lit as a concept or not) 

- "Prestige is not just a reputation-enhancer, as it is in a coterie; reputation in a scholarly field earns financial and status rewards: speaking invitations, endowed proffessorships, research budgets, festschifts" 

- e-lit began as a coterie- has become a scholarly field
