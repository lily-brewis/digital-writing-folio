### Questions 

#### What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)? 

Potry and fiction make up the majority of my writing. Some classes have pushed me towards genres that are new to me and I have therefore dabbled in nonfiction 
and screen writing, the latter of which I took a liking to and hope to continue. 

#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write? 

It depends on what I am writing. When I write fiction or anything longform that is subject to a lot of changes, I use a computer and a trusty microsoft
word document for ease of writing and editing. Poetry on the other hand, I prefer to write with pen and paper, partially for the aesthetic quality, but mostly 
because I know anything I write I am unlikely to touch, edit, or do anyhting with, so I don't feel the need to save it digitally. 

#### How do these tools shape the way you write (eg., constrain the way you write or facilitate it)? 

They largely dictate my intentions with each individual piece that I write. Technology facilitates my writiting in that it allows me to make an endless amount 
of mistakes, edits and additions to a piece, and also enables me to save or recall past versions of a piece of work. On the other hand, working without the aid of 
technology creates something of a snapshot in time of my work and my creative proccess that I sometimes enjoy. 

## Week 2 

### How is electronic literature different from print literature?

The first answer that comes to mind is a fairly obvious one - one is print based and on is electronic based. The methods of creating these types of literature
differ, with print literature exisiting as something that can be made with or without digital facilitation, and electronic literature relying on and utilising 
digitalisation. The intent, the execution, reception and qualitites have their differences too. 

### What are some of the qualities of electronic literature? 

The Electronic Literature Organisation (ELO) defines electronic literature as works with important literary aspects that take advantage of the capabilities
and contexts provided by the stand-alone or networked computer.' 

Some attributes of the stand-alone or networked computer that contribute to electronic literature's identity are features like graphics and images, colours, 
animation, audio, coding and programming, interactivity, and a host of other qualitites, many of which are exclusive to literature created electronically.
